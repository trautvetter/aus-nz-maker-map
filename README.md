## Welcome

When I started my YouTube channel in late 2017 I knew of only two other NZ YouTubers. (Joey @ KingPost TimberWorks & Tim @ The Offcut) Both of these channels had been long time favourites of mine and I started to wonder if there were more. I next discovered Vic @ DownUnderWoodWorks and a whole host of other cool Australia channels. As each person mentioned their particular location in the odd video here and there I developed a mental map of everyone (I'm a visual learner) and this is the fruition of what I know to to date of the Aus/NZ social maker scene.
